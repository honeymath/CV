## Currently doing

- Recently I am studying linear AFL on function fields. The difficult part is the non-triviality of the support of the perverse sheaves. The similar difficulty arises in many generalizations of Ngo's method to general Hecke functions. I will write a notes on the classification of invariants when studying orbits in Guo-Jacquet type of fundamental lemmas and compute several example on GL4 to show the non-triviality of the support.

### Linear Algebra Education Tools

***Row Operation Calculator***


Row operation calculator increases learning experience by enabling students perform matrix operations more quickly. In contrast to other tools, this calculator is waiting for their action and let them learn by doing. This calculator is capable for finding inverse, eigenvectors and all other purposes.

***Matrix Cross Filler***

Cross-filling decomposition decomposes a matrix into rank 1 matrices. Invented in 2020, and build in 2023. This tool can be used to perferm LU decomposition, and Cholesky decomposition. It does not give the final result, but let student learn by doing.

Feature: This project promotes user experience with key-less input design. Finger-only input.

Github [github.com/honeymath/crossfiller](https://github.com/honeymath/crossfiller)

Technologies used: PixelJS, a game platform

<!-- Old projects
**(Game)JumpChild**
2003 This is a game I create for fun when I was a kid. The game attracts many of my classmates for testing.
 Ongoing projects
**PathFlow**
Pathflow simplifies the data processing process using XPath, JSONPath, and File System Paths. It is motivated by mathematical way of representing symbols. It minimizes the code needed for buiding a prototype data processing pipeline. It simplifies the process of data update automation especially processing thoese data from internet. With the help of Large Language Model, it can be used in various applications.
Technologies used: Python, Pyparse.
**The QuizBooster for AI**
It is the next version of honeymath. The QuizBooster is a platform for quiz-scripts that can be used for educators, AI trainers, and LLM developers. A quiz-script is a python code that provide instant feedback and automatic prompting to promote effectiveness and quality of LLM output. The answers provided by the LLM during doing a quiz makes the whole workflow tracaable and reproducible. The QuizBooster is a platform that can be used to create, share, test, and run quiz-scripts.

## Textbook of linear algebra

I have write some textbook of linear algebra. The idea is to use some new method of introducing linear algebra. It uses projection matrix and Lagurange interpolation polynomial to simplifies everything. The book is still in progress.
