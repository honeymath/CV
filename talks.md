Talk title: Hecke Operators in Fundamental Lemmas for Gross–Zagier Type Formulas on GL(2n)

Fundamental lemmas play a central role in the Langlands program and in applications to the study of L-functions via the relative trace formula. Guo proposed a fundamental lemma generalizing Waldspurger’s formula to general linear groups GL_2n, and proved it for the unit element by establishing an equivalence with the quadratic base-change fundamental lemma. For decades, this result was thought to hold only in the unit case. We show that the method extends to a slightly broader class of Hecke functions, though these functions reveal the natural limits of the approach. Our construction also provides fundamental tools for studying general Hecke functions in the arithmetic setting, which are essential for proving Gross–Zagier–type formulas for GL_2n.

Title: Around the Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma: Settings in Higher Derivatives and Higher Dimensions

Abstract: The Fundamental Lemma (FL) and its many generalizations occupy a central position in the Langlands program. In this talk, I will focus on the Relative Trace Formula approach to the Gross–Zagier formula, known as the linear arithmetic fundamental lemma (linear AFL).

I will begin by presenting a formulation of the linear AFL in the setting of higher derivatives, based on joint work with Andreas Mihatsch and Wei Zhang. I will then review related developments in recent years, highlighting various strategies proposed for proving the lemma. The goal of this talk is to clarify several equivalent forms of the linear AFL and propose a framework that supports the extension of the linear AFL to higher-dimensional cases.

Title: Arithmetic Fundamental Lemmas and Higher Derivatives of L-functions

Abstract:
The Fundamental Lemma (FL), initially developed within the framework of the Langlands program, has since found applications beyond its original context, connecting number theory, automorphic representations, harmonic analysis, and geometry. In this talk, I will outline the history and significance of the FL and its arithmetic generalization, the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL), which arises from the Relative Trace Formula in the study of the Gross–Zagier formula. These lemmas serve as a bridge between intricate integrals and their combinatorial or geometric interpretations, reflecting their foundational role in mathematics.

I will present a recent collaborative project with Andreas Mihatsch and Wei Zhang on higher derivatives of L-functions, with particular emphasis on the connection between the Guo–Jacquet Fundamental Lemma and intersection theory. After discussing the technical challenges in proving the Guo–Jacquet FL, I will delve into the study of higher derivatives of orbital integrals in this context.

Our work interprets these derivatives as intersection numbers on local Shtukas, drawing inspiration from Yun and Zhang’s work on the higher Gross–Zagier formula. Additionally, I will touch on the geometrization of the Guo–Jacquet FL for function fields, highlighting its link to Hitchin fibrations and offering insights into the relationship between geometry and analysis. This approach illustrates the evolving connections and potential for further exploration in the field.

Title: The linear arithmetic fundamental lemma for higher derivatives.

Abstract: The Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) arises from the Relative Trace Formula approach to the Gross–Zagier formula and generalizes the Guo–Jacquet Fundamental Lemma. In this talk, we review recent progress on the linear AFL and introduce our collaborative project on higher derivatives with Andreas Mihatsch and Wei Zhang. Our work explores the interpretation of higher derivatives of Guo–Jacquet orbital integrals through intersection numbers on local Shtukas. This result is a local field analogue of Yun and Zhang’s work on higher Gross–Zagier formula. We will introduce the geometrization of Guo–Jacquet Fundamental Lemma for the function field and describe its Hitchin fibration.

Talk online at "AGNT" seminar at Ben Gurion University in Israel over Zoom

Dear Qirui, 

I'm writing on the recommendation of my colleague Daniel Disegni to invite you to give a talk at the "AGNT" seminar at Ben Gurion University in Israel over Zoom. The seminar takes Wednesdays 16:10-17:15 Israel = 15:10-16:15 Germany. How about May 25th?

Abstract:
Title: The linear AFL for non-basic locus.

The Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) is a local conjecture motivated by decomposing both sides of the Gross—Zagier Formula into local terms using the Relative Trace formula. For each of the local terms, one side is the intersection number in some Rappoport—Zink space. The other side is some orbital integral. To reduce the global computation to local, one needs to consider intersection numbers on both basic and non-basic locus, while the original linear AFL only considers basic locus.

Collaborated with Andreas Mihatsch, we consider the non-basic locus of Unitary Shimura varieties and conjectured a similar version of linear AFL for Rappoport Zink space on non-basic locus parameterizing p-divisible groups with étale extensions. We proved that this version of linear AFL conjecture can be essentially reduced to the linear AFL conjecture for Lubin—Tate spaces, which corresponds to the basic locus parameterizing one-dimensional connected p-divisible groups.

Part 1:

The Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) is a local conjecture motivated by decomposing both sides of the Gross—Zagier Formula into local terms using the Relative Trace formula. For each of the local terms, one side is the intersection number in some Rappoport—Zink space. The other side is some orbital integral.

We proved that this version of linear AFL conjecture can be essentially reduced to the linear AFL conjecture for Lubin—Tate spaces, which parameterizes connected p-divisible groups.

Part 2
	
This talk continues the discussion from our last talk. On the analytic side, there is a reduction formula reducing the value of the orbital integrals for non-elliptic orbits into a linear combination of certain products of orbital integrals for elliptic orbits, which was proved by Jiandong Guo. Our project is an arithmetic generalization for such a reduction formula. We proved a similar phenomenon for intersection numbers in certain RZ spaces as well.

Title: Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma and Intersection Numbers for CM Cycles on Lubin-Tate Spaces

The central values and derivatives of L-functions are studied in the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture and its arithmetic generalizations. These type of problems originally started from the study of Waldspurger furmula and Gross-Zagier formula. Recently, in the function field case, Yun and Zhang have discovered a higher Gross--Zagier formula, relating higher derivatives of L-functions to intersection numbers of special cycles on the moduli space of Drinfeld Shtukas of rank two.

The Guo-Jacquet Fundamental Lemma is a higher dimensional generalization of the local field analogue of the Waldspurger formula. It has an arithmetic generalization called the Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma. We will introduce the known results for the linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma, and the intersection number formula for Lubin-Tate spaces. After a joint work with Ben Howard, we also discovered a bi-quadratic generalization of the conjecture.

Title: Intersection number formula on Lubin-Tate spaces.

Abstract: We consider a moduli space classifying deformations of a formal module over \bar F_q. Those spaces are called Lubin Tate deformation spaces. We will construct some CM cycles on this space. By adding Drinfeld level structures, we proved a formula for the intersection number between these CM cycles.
