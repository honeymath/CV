This is the first paper showing the existence of linear AFL in the inner form settings.

In partnership with Andreas Mihatsch, we extended this generalization to inner forms in our paper "Arithmetic Transfer for Inner Forms of GL_2n" (arXiv:2307.11716), soon to appear in Forum of Mathematics, Sigma. During our collaboration, we advanced the theory by integrating it with the Bruhat–Tits building theory—a framework established for analyzing the geometry of reductive groups over local fields. This integration significantly expedited our computations and provided deeper insights.

On the geometric side of the fundamental lemma, the application of the Bruhat–Tits building theory allowed us to merge combinatorial methods with geometric perspectives. This fusion not only enriched the theoretical framework but also facilitated more comprehensive analyses.


The primary aim of this paper is to present non-trivial examples for explicit calculations. We successfully identified and detailed matching functions within these examples—functions whose existence had been previously asserted but not explicitly constructed. Additionally, we provided a thorough classification of different cases pertinent to the study of the linear AFL, thereby offering a complete roadmap for future research in this area.
