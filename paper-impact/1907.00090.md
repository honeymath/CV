This paper presents a computational algorithm to prove the Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) for GL_4. The earlier proof for GL_2 was insufficient to establish the validity of the Linear AFL, as it could be derived from the Jacquet–Rallis Fundamental Lemma. Thus, confirming the Linear AFL required addressing the GL_4 case as the first critical step.

The work builds on results from \cite{1803.07553}, which translated the Linear AFL into a computable identity, making verification via computers feasible. However, this computation involves integration over symmetric spaces. To address this challenge, the paper introduces a novel method for integrating over symmetric spaces, termed "integration by fibration." This approach serves as a computational tool specifically designed for such integrals.

Furthermore, the paper employs an analytical method to derive an inductive formula that verifies the correctness of the Linear AFL for specific orbits of all GL_{2n}. This makes it possible to confirm the conjecture computationally.

This is the first evidencal example to convince people of linear AFL.
