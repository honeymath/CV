In the paper "An Intersection Formula of CM Cycles on Lubin–Tate Spaces," we establish an explicit formula for the intersection numbers of CM (Complex Multiplication) cycles on Lubin–Tate spaces with arbitrary level structures. This represents the first non-conjectural formula for such intersection numbers, overcoming the significant challenge that the equations defining Lubin–Tate spaces and their CM cycles are too complex to be written down explicitly.

Also, this was the first paper that writes down the linear AFL conjecture.

### Little background on Lubin--Tate spaces:
- Lubin--Tate space has appeared in many fundamental conjectures in Number Theory:

- Local Langlands Correspondence: Lubin–Tate spaces are used to realize the local Langlands correspondence for GL_n , providing a geometric framework for understanding the correspondence between p-adic representations of the Galois group and representations of GL_n. 


- Breuil–Mézard Conjecture: These spaces are central to the formulation and study of the Breuil–Mézard conjecture, which relates modular representation theory and p-adic Hodge theory by connecting the geometry of deformation spaces to representation-theoretic properties.

- Kisin's Work on Modularity Lifting: Lubin–Tate spaces feature prominently in Kisin's work on modularity lifting theorems, which are crucial for proving instances of the Langlands program and for understanding the relationship between Galois representations and modular forms.

- Linear AFL, the arithmetic generalization of Fundamental Lemma, with one side replaced by intersection numbers in Lubin--Tate spaces. Calculating such an intersection is challanging. This is also one of the motivation of this paper.

- Lubin--Tate space is related to homotopy theory: ...

At most time, the Lubin--Tate space is a frequent candidate in many key idea of proofs and key constructions. The researcher can not avoid it.

### Lubin--Tate space is extremely difficult because 

- However, it is hard to write down equations for many of its naturally constructed important subspaces. One subspace of great importance is called CM cycles, it can be constructed from explicit way. CM cycles is a natural way to embed small Lubin--Tate space to a larger Lubin--Tate space. 

- Previously, very little was known about explicit description of Lubin--Tate spaces.

 Geometric intersection number is always a hard problem since we compute the equation of intersections of two lines where these two lines have no close form equations. The highly non-trivial nature make Lubin--Tate space impossible to study with the traditional method.

## Impacts of this paper

- Algorithm of computer proof of the Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (ArXiv:1907.00090): The explicit formula provided in our work was instrumental in proving the linear AFL. By making the geometric side accessible, it allowed researchers to focus on the analytical aspects, leading to a complete proof of the linear AFL, which is a critical component in the Langlands program and the study of automorphic forms.

- Proof of Equidistribution of CM Points (ArXiv:1904.07743): Our formula contributed to the proof of the equidistribution of CM points on Shimura varieties. By providing explicit intersection numbers, it advanced the understanding of how CM points are distributed, which has implications for both arithmetic geometry and number theory.

- Alternative Proof of Gross–Keating's Result on Lifting Endomorphisms (ArXiv:1902.10789): Using our methods, another proof of Gross–Keating's result was established. This result concerns the lifting of endomorphisms of formal modules, and our explicit calculations provided new insights into the arithmetic of quadratic forms and the structure of formal groups.

- Study of the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma for Spherical Hecke Algebras (ArXiv:2305.14465) by Congling Qiu: Our explicit formula was utilized to study the AFL for spherical Hecke algebras. This work extends the applicability of the AFL to new contexts, demonstrating the versatility of our methods and their relevance to representation theory.
