### Main contributions:

In the paper "On the Linear AFL: The Non-Basic Case," we extend the study of the Linear Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (Linear AFL) to encompass the non-basic locus—a domain previously unexplored in this context. Historically, analyses of the AFL and its variants have been confined to the basic locus, particularly in settings involving unitary groups. In these cases, the local factors of global problems do not involve the non-basic locus, and thus, methods for addressing it were undeveloped.

The problem of the non-basic locus first emerged in the study of the Linear AFL for general linear groups, highlighting both the originality and significance of our work. The presence of the non-basic locus introduces additional complexities that cannot be addressed using existing techniques.

Our work bridges the gap between local and global applications by developing new methods that geometrizes the reduction formula for orbital integrals -- a classical formula traditionally used to reduce all cases to the basic case in the fundamental lemma. By geometrizing this reduction formula, we construct new Rapoport–Zink spaces specifically tailored to the non-basic case. This construction not only enriches the family of Rapoport–Zink spaces but also provides a geometric framework for studying orbital integrals with unramified invariants. 

As a result of this geometrization, we introduce new moduli spaces that facilitate the study of orbital integrals in more complex settings. Furthermore, the significance of our work is underscored in the appendix, where we offer a completely new perspective on the Hecke algebra -- a fundamental structure in the representation theory of $p$-adic groups. This new perspective geometrically interprets the Hecke algebra, providing a fresh outlook on its properties and applications.
