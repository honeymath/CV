- task: 4
  summary: >
    Across all four citing papers, "On the Linear AFL: The Non-Basic Case" (Li–Mihatsch) is consistently positioned as a
    foundational and technically rigorous contribution to the study of arithmetic intersection theory and p-adic variants of the AFL.
    The citing papers span both expository surveys and highly technical extensions of the AFL, and they cite the paper not only for context
    but also to directly support definitions, conjectures, and proof strategies.

    These patterns show that Li–Mihatsch (arXiv:2208.10144) is now part of the core technical machinery used in
    formulating and proving refined versions of the Arithmetic Fundamental Lemma (AFL) and related conjectures.
    It plays a dual role: on one hand, as a toolkit of precise lemmas and definitions for advanced technical arguments;
    on the other, as a conceptual bridge for extending AFL to more general non-basic and Iwahori-level settings.
    The paper is not merely cited for context—it is used, built upon, and trusted as a reliable and extendable technical base.

  roles:
    - role: Technical Foundation
      evidence:
        - "Paper [2410.08401] uses Proposition 3.4 from Li–Mihatsch as a key input in confirming Hecke equivariance in the Iwahori level setting."
        - "Paper [2308.02458] builds entire sections upon the formalism, definitions, and lemmas from Li–Mihatsch, showing full structural dependency."

    - role: Reference Standard
      evidence:
        - "Paper [2402.17656] (a survey by W. Zhang) points readers to Li–Mihatsch for standard background on global Shimura varieties with CM cycles."
        - "The citation appears in the introduction, indicating recognition as a standard reference."

    - role: Methodological Blueprint
      evidence:
        - "Paper [2112.10018] uses Lemma 3.6 of Li–Mihatsch to support local arguments on δ-forms in Lubin–Tate settings."
